# How you can help!

osu!, like any other game, has a very vibrant community, composed of people from all around the world, with differing skill sets and different purposes.


Anyone can be a part of the community in their own way. Here are a few examples to start with:


## Help out with the wiki

[The wiki](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki) is our official knowledge base about anything and everything about osu!. The wiki is always looking for more contributors to help keep the site up to date with fresh new knowledge, and to reach a wider audience via translations.

For newcomers, you can read more about it in the [osu! wiki Contribution Guide](/wiki/osu!_wiki_Contribution_Guide).

## Help keep osu! friendly and safe

To keep the official community hubs safe, osu! has a dedicated moderation team that monitors them around the clock. However, they keep track of most channels in the chat, and countless entries in the forums.

Fortunately, it is still easy for you to help out keeping everything safe, here are some things you can do to help:

- Follow your favourite channels in the [osu! in-game chat](/wiki/Chat_Console), or in the forums on the web.
- If you see something happening that you think is inappropriate or disturbing in any way, use the `!report` command in the in-game chat to notify the moderators of it.

## Help other community members

Lend someone a hand when they encounter an issue with the game! Whether it is a driver issue, a beatmap question, or gameplay questions, if you can answer it, you help the person in solving their problem.

You can begin with lending people a hand on the following mediums:

- Choose a forum that sparks your interest:
   - [Technical Support](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/5)
   - [Beatmapping Support](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/56)
   - [Storyboarding](/https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/20)
   - [Gameplay and Rankings](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/13)
- Mark the forum as read using the link at the top right.
- Follow any new threads, reading each one and helping out when you can. You can use the unread icons to make sure you keep up.
- Read the [available guides](/wiki/Guides) to polish up on your osu! knowledge. If the guides in there does not satisfy you, then contribute to them.

## Help check/mod beatmaps!

osu! has a dedicated team of reviewers to check if the beatmaps are ready to be ranked and played by everyone. However, that does not stop you from contributing in this sector, so here are a few things you can do to help:

- Look through or search the [Pending Beatmaps](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=pending) listing for any artists or songs you like (or just choose at random).
- Play beatmaps in the pending or work in progress stages and leave feedback in the beatmap's discussion page.
- Read the [Modding Guide](/wiki/Modding "Modding") and the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria "Ranking Criteria") to know the basics of technical modding and what makes a beatmap rankable.
- Join the `#modhelp` and `#modreqs` on the in-game chat and join in on the conversation (or just follow along).
- If you have the time and dedication, make a [Modding Queue](/community/forums/60) to give beatmap creators a place to request you for mods.

## Help/join user-run community projects

osu! has a thriving community of technical and competitive people. They range from hobbyist tinkers, to seasoned rhythm game veterans. There are a lot of proposals and projects being made exclusively for osu! and you can help them, or drive the future of osu! with your own!

Here are a few things you can do to participate:

- Browse the [tournaments](/community/forums/55) forum. Tournaments take time and a lot of manpower to organize without hitches, and you can help out by being a spectator judge in some cases.
- Check out what is going on in [General Development](/community/forums/2). This low activity forum is where the most serious projects happen.
- Join a [beatmap project](/community/forums/53) and learn how fun collaborating with others can be!
- Start your own project! Whether it is bringing back dancing pippi, or just making something cool for osu!, anything is accepted.

## Contribute to the future of osu!

Started in 2017, the osu!lazer project is the current focus of the osu! team, along with the new website, which you see today.

You can help make them even better, and make us closer to the future of osu! by helping on these areas:

- Helping with the [osu!lazer](https://github.com/ppy/osu) project. There is much to implement on the new version of osu!, and you can help make it happen!
- Make the [new website](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web) even better.

## Avoid being negative! Make people happy!

There is an old saying that you should become part of the solution, not the problem. You can help on osu! by making the community a brighter place. People complain, but there are many ways you can help lighten up the mood in the community:

- Be friendly to each other. Life is too short to argue.
- [Report cheaters when you see them](/wiki/Reporting_Bad_Behavior/Handing_Cheating "Handling Cheating"). Do not complain about them on other mediums, a simple `!report <username> seems to be cheating` can fix your problems within minutes to hours.
- Go out of your way to mediate negative situations and turn them into positive outcomes.

While this article cannot cover how much more you can help the osu! community, simply playing the game as well can make osu! even more awesome!
