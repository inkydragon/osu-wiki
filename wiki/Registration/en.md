# Registration

*Warning: Having more than one osu! user account at any time is an infringement against the [osu! rules](/wiki/Rules)!*

1.  After [installing](/wiki/installation) osu! and running it, osu! will prompt you to sign in or register. Assuming that you're here because you need an account, click `Create an account` and keep osu! opened. This should open the [Create Account](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/register) web page.

2.  Fill out all of the fields in the form.
    -   For the username field, there is a maximum of 15 characters; of which can only be alphanumeric characters (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`), underscores (`_`), square brackets, (`[` and `]`), dashes (`-`), and spaces (` `).
    -   For the email address field, use your email. This is used to reset your password and to send you verification codes when needed, so don't use a throw away email.
    -   For the password field, use a password that is at least 8 characters long.
3.  Once this is completed, press `Continue` then go back to osu!
4.  Sign in to complete registration.

Once that is done, you are now ready to start your rhythm adventure!

You could also stop by and say, "Hi," in the [Introductions subforum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/8).
