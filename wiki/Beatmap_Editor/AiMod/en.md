# AiMod

**AiMod** is a modding tool built into the [Beatmap Editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor). To open AiMod, press `Control` + `Shift` + `A` or navigate via menu options **File** » **Open AiMod** once a beatmap is open in the Beatmap Editor.

AiMod aims to help beginner mappers "mod" their beatmaps. The limitation of AiMod lies with its basic design which causes it to sometimes overlook issues such as bad mapping patterns, BPM, or timing. Finding a [modder](/wiki/Glossary) to mod your beatmap is strongly recommended.

AiMod typically completes its beatmap analysis in under a minute and subsequently displays warnings and errors. If no problems were found in your beatmap, then congratulations! The beatmap passed the AiMod analysis, but it still requires modding from the community. The modders can find other issues that AiMod failed to detect.

## Tabs

**All**

-   Gathers the items from the other tabs.

**Compose**

-   These problems are generally the problem of object placement.
    -   You may need to check the "Check distance snap" box for these warnings to appear (as these checks could cause lag, depending on beatmap size/length)

**Design**

-   These problems are generally some of the interface issues, such as the background, storyboards, etc.

**Timing**

-   When these problems appear, check the timeline because something is probably placed incorrectly.

**Meta**

-   When these problems appear, check out the song setup.

**Mapset**

-   These problems affect the mapset as a whole.

| This slider moves in an abnormal way. | | |
| This combo is very long. Consider splitting it up. | The length of combos can affect the difficulty of the map, as well as the amount of fruits that will be stacked on the catcher's plate. | Go to the offending combos and decide where to start the new combo. (It is prefered that length of combos are, at most, 15-18) |
| This spinner appears onscreen later than objects which follow it. | Objects appear while the spinner is active. This could be caused by having low AR and/or placing objects too close (time-wise) to the spinner. | Change the length of the spinner and/or remove the following objects |
| Object's end is offscreen! | Objects that are offscreen may not be seen in osu!clients running in 4:3 ratios. | Remove or move the object's end |
| Object is offscreen! | Objects that are offscreen may not be seen in osu!clients running in 4:3 ratios. | Remove or move the object |
| This object is too close to the previous object. | | |
| This object is too far from the previous object. | | |
| This spinner is too short. Auto must achieve at least 1000 bonus points on spinners. | The specified spinner is too short; this will make it impossible to obtain a SS. | Find the spinner and remove it or make the spinner a bit longer about 3 whole beats. |
| These two objects exist at the same point in time! | Two objects are on top of each other. This will make the map impossible to rank! | Find the two hit objects and move it or delete it. |
| Spinners must have a new combo. | | |
| Object isn't snapped! | The specified object isn't snapped onto the timeline. | Check the timing, if you made a change to it, you may need to resnap all the notes (you can do this manually or click Timing » Resnap all notes (if you do this, you will need to check to see if any notes were placed in the wrong spot!)). |
| Object's end is not snapped! | The specified object's end isn't snapped onto the timeline. | Check the timing, if you made a change to it, you may need to resnap all the notes (you can do this manually or click Timing » Resnap all notes (if you do this, you will need to check to see if any notes were placed in the wrong spot!)). |
| This hold note is less than 10ms long! | osu!mania maps only! This will require the player to press and release the key at a very quick rate, making your map impossible to obtain an SS. | |
| This object overlaps with another object. | osu!mania maps only! | |
| This object is stacked on top of another object. | osu!mania maps only! The specified keys and/or hold notes are on top of each other. This will make your map impossible to obtain an SS! | Find the key or hold note and fix it or delete it. |
| More than 6 notes simultaneously is not allowed. | osu!mania maps only! Most keyboards can allow up to 6 key presses at once. | Check your beatmap to make sure that each column has at most 6 note presses. |
